We define a class of Ising models Mdn on d‐dimensional lattices characterized by a number n = 1, 2, … , d (n = 1 corresponds to the Ising model with two‐spin interaction). These models are related by two duality transformations. The models with 1 \\&lt; n \\&lt; d exhibit a phase transition without local order parameter. A nonanalyticity in the specific heat and a different qualitative behavior of certain spin correlation functions in the low and the high temperature phases indicate the existence of a phase transition. The Hamiltonian of the simple cubic dual model contains products of four Ising spin operators. Applying a star square transformation, one obtains an Ising model with competing interactions exhibiting a singularity in the specific heat but no long‐range order of the spins in the low temperature phase.}",

A general relationship is established between the two partition functions of a general quantal spin system and the corresponding Ising model with many-spin interactions, which yields some rigorous results on quantum systems.
